## Did you find a bug ?

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/brpinto/swu-companion-app/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/brpinto/swu-companion-app/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug ?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable. Make sure to include as much relevant information as possible, including a code sample or failing test that demonstrates the expected behavior, as well as your system configuration. Your goal should be to make it easy for yourself - and others - to reproduce the bug and figure out a fix.

## How about cosmetic patch ?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of SWU Companion will generally not be accepted as it is time consuming.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one ?

- Suggest your change in the [SWU Companion GitHub discussions](https://github.com/brpinto/swu-companion-app/discussions) and start writing code.

- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.
