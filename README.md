### Disclaimer

SWU Companion is an unofficial companion app for Star Wars: Unlimited. It is not affiliated with, endorsed, sponsored, or approved by Fantasy Flight Games, Asmodee, Lucasfilm Ltd., or Disney.

Star Wars: Unlimited, its logo, artwork, and card designs are the property of their respective owners. This app is intended for informational and reference purposes under fair use guidelines. If any content needs to be removed or modified, please contact us.

## Features

- Check existing cards
- Search specific cards
- Add cards to your collection
- Deck building (ðŸš§)
- Read rules (ðŸ§­)

## Installation

Install the dependencies using `yarn` command.
First create a local `.env` file in order to put environment variables needed for the project with the following :

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

As SWU Companion is using its own API to request cards database, you will have to take a look at the public API repository too.

## Usage

As an application built with Expo, you can either launch the app with Expo, Android Studio or Xcode

```bash
# building with npx (brackets not needed)
npx expo run:[ios/android]

# building with yarn
yarn run [ios/android]
```

As **Android** requires a safe environment to run, you will probably need to use a tool like **ngrok** for it to work with the API we use to get cards informations :

```bash
# generate a secure URL for port 3000
ngrok http 3000
```

Just replace the `localhost:3000` URL in the `.env` file (you need to create it yourself) by the generated https forwarding URL.

If your want to build SWU Companion with Android Studio or Xcode, make sure to prebuild the app first :

```bash
# using npx or yarn
[npx/yarn] expo prebuild --platform [android/ios]
```
